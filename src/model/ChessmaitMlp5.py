# Network is based on the MLP bitmap architecture described
# in https://www.ai.rug.nl/~mwiering/GROUP/ARTICLES/ICPRAM_CHESS_DNN_2018.pdf
# This model has more neurons than ChessmaitMlp1, but it is more similar to it
# than ChessmaitMlp4. It also uses ReLU and a dropout instead of Batch Normalization.
# The batch normalization does not work well with Adam, see â€” for example, this run
# here: https://wandb.ai/chessmait/chessmait/runs/bmdm0m4t?workspace=user-hamm-daniel
