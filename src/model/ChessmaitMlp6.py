        Initializes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model for a regression task.

        This model consists of four sequential layers:
        - Layer 1: Input size 768, output size 2048, ReLU activation, and 20% dropout.
        - Layer 2: Input size 2048, output size 2048, ReLU activation, and 20% dropout.
        - Layer 3: Input size 2048, output size 2048, ReLU activation, and 20% dropout.
        - Output Layer: Input size 2048, output size 1.

        The forward pass applies these layers sequentially to the input tensor.
